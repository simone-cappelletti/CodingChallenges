# CodingChallenges

Here you can find some coding challenges taken from https://codingchallenges.fyi/.

## Write Your Own wc Tool
I used this coding challenge just to get in touch with a famous open source library that is commonly used like https://github.com/commandlineparser/commandline.
I implemented a very simple command line parser and compared to the original challenge, I kept the command line more general to have the possibility to use more than one single verb.

## Write Your Own JSON Parser
I simplify this test avoiding to rewrite a parser from scratch but I took the opportunity to implement a kind of JSON beautify so you can copy/paste your single-line JSON and get a beautified one.

As example:
